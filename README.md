# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

I am a father of one and a loving husband who has decided to try his hand in programming.
My journey started Nov 2021 with no prior experience, however with the passion to learn.
As of now I have been studying Python language and enjoy it way more than I thought I would.
Enough about me and lets "Git" the show started!!! ;)
